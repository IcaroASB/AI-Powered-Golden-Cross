We developed two AI agents that will balance their stock portfolios using similar moving average strategies tuned to different parameters. We run their strategies on stock price data from 2000 to 2010 and will split this interval into multiple rounds. At the end of each round, the agent with a lower profit adjusts its parameters to be closer to the victorious agent. At the end of all rounds, the agents converge (or closely converge) to similar parameters. We then tested these new parameters, as well as the initial parameters, with data from 2010 to 2020, identifying statistically significant improvement in order to justify autonomous continuous learning for parameter tuning in trading models.

In future developments, we may include a third agent that uses dynamic parameters-based market indexes and explore this behavior with the AI competition.
